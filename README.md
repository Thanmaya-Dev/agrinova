AGRINOVA HAS TWO COMPONENTS:
1.A SOFTWARE DESKTOP APPLICATION
2.A HARDWARE DEVICE WHICH I BUILT USING ESP32 AND OTHER SENSORS
WE CAN CONNECT HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE VIA WIFI PROVIDING WIRELESS CONNECTION
The proposed system, Agrinova, aims to empower farmers by providing data-driven insights into soil health and crop suitability. It utilizes advanced sensors, real-time data collection, and machine learning to suggest the best crops for a specific soil condition, ultimately enhancing productivity and promoting sustainable farming practices.

FEATURES:
1.Smart Crop Prediction:
The system uses real-time soil data (moisture, temperature, and humidity) to predict the best crops for a 
s      specific soil condition.
2.Data-Driven Insights:
By utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms (Random Forest), Agrinova offers precise and actionable insights, helping farmers make informed decisions.
3.Real-Time Soil Monitoring:
The system continuously monitors soil health through IoT-enabled sensors, providing farmers with up-to-date information about their fields.
4.Sustainability:
Reduces overuse of fertilizers and water, promoting sustainable farming practices and reducing environmental impact.
5.User-Friendly Interface:
The web-based dashboard is easy to use, allowing farmers with limited technical knowledge to access and interpret the data.


6.Cost Reduction:
By optimizing resource usage (fertilizers, water, etc.), the system helps farmers lower input costs 
                   and improve crop yield efficiency.
7.Wireless Communication:
Data is transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi, ensuring seamless connectivity between the sensors and the system, even in remote farming areas.
8.Scalable Solution:
The system is designed to be scalable, supporting small to large farming operations, and can be expanded to
         support more sensors or additional features as needed.
